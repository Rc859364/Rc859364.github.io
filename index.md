## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

### **Lab 3: Introduction to Fundamental Programming Concepts**
Lab 3 was my introduction to fundamental programming concepts. I particularly enjoyed learning how to use arithmetic operators and functions to solve problems. Testing my code for correctness using black-box testing helped me understand the importance of robust testing practices. This lab made me more confident in implementing basic algorithms and debugging my code effectively. I realized how critical it is to test my code thoroughly before assuming it's working properly.

### **Lab 5: Collaborative Pair Programming**
In Lab 5, I appreciated the collaborative aspect of pair programming. It was rewarding to break down problems into smaller parts, implementing if statements to define domain logic, and using tests to verify our work. This lab helped me become comfortable with multi-file projects and the `make` command, reinforcing the significance of teamwork and clear communication in programming. The experience also taught me how to better manage version control and resolve conflicts when collaborating on larger projects. 

### **Lab 7: Input Validation and Error Handling**
Lab 7 challenged me to think critically about input validation and error handling. Defensive programming helped me anticipate and manage potential issues. Implementing compound Boolean expressions to enforce rules was both educational and satisfying. This lab provided me with valuable insights into writing more secure and resilient code, as well as the importance of validating user inputs to avoid errors or crashes. I learned how critical it is to prevent security vulnerabilities by thoroughly checking user inputs before processing them.
