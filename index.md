                                     ## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 
  *Lab 3 was my introduction to fundamental programming concepts. I particularly enjoyed learning how to use arithmetic operators and functions to solve problems. Testing my code for correctness using black-box testing helped me understand the importance of robust testing practices.
  
  *In Lab 5, I appreciated the collaborative aspect of pair programming. It was rewarding to break down problems into smaller parts, implementing if statements to define domain logic, and using tests to verify our work. This lab helped me become comfortable with multi-file projects and the make command.

   *Lab 7 challenged me to think critically about input validation and error handling. Defensive programming helped me anticipate and manage potential issues. Implementing compound Boolean expressions to enforce rules was both educational and satisfying.
